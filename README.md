# PR Auto Action

A GitHub action to automatically merge PRs that only have one line changed upon comments. This repo was created for [](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-localhost-github)

Checks:
1. Did someone comment? Great, we're running the action.
2. Is there only one line added? Great, we're merging!

Special thanks to [the Frontside Discord community](https://discord.gg/YxWuzm4WR4) for helping me debug and get past a major blocker, especially [minkimcello](https://github.com/minkimcello) and JacobBolda!
